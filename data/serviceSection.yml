      #### Configured in annotations

      All the Hypper configs are done in chart annotations so
      expanding existing charts is as easy as writing some extra lines.

      #### Feel at home with Hypper

      Hypper is fully compatible with Helm Charts so there is no need to
      change them in any way, they will just work
      out of the box with no changes.

      #### Shared dependencies

      Hypper is able to understand shared dependencies,
      so you can share apps for different charts, making your infrastructure easier and simpler
